Nobody other than you will be accountable for any decisions you make. How much income you get, and how long your pension lasts, will depend on how much you withdraw (particularly in the early years), the returns you achieve and how long you live.

In the worst case you could run out of money entirely, leaving you reliant on the State. Unlike an annuity, which provides a secure income for life, your income isn’t guaranteed with drawdown.

        "warning": "Unlike an annuity, income from drawdown isn’t secure and will vary. If you withdraw more than the growth provided by your pension investments, withdrawals won’t be sustainable. Selling investments to create income increases the risk of running out of money. Taking just the income provided by the growth of your investments is known as taking the ‘natural yield’. This generally carries lower risks than selling your investments to create an income, which is known as ‘drawing from capital’.

This income is added to any other income you’ve received in that tax year. So taking large withdrawals could mean you’re pushed into a higher tax bracket. For investors taking an income for the first time, it’s likely emergency tax will be deducted. If you pay too much tax you’ll be able to reclaim this from HMRC directly. The tax you pay and any benefits you receive will depend on your circumstances. Tax rules can change in the future. If you’re still unsure don’t continue. Seek personal advice or guidance.",

Shopping around allows you to compare the different options, including the benefits and risks, and services of different providers.

Most investments carry charges, and the money you ultimately receive depends on the investment returns, less any charges.

Future contributions to money purchase pensions, such as SIPPs and other personal pensions, could be restricted to a maximum allowance of £4,000 each tax year. This is known as the Money Purchase Annual Allowance (MPAA). This allowance figure includes employer contributions and any tax relief received or due on the contributions made.

For example, between July 2000 and July 2020, inflation saw the costs of goods and services rise by 73.6%.
